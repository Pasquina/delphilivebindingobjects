# Delphi LiveBindings With Objects
## Overview
Delphi LiveBindings With Objects is a short exploration of ways to implement LiveBindings using objects and object lists as a data source. This Github project contains a Delphi Project Group consisting of a single project that illustrates how to display the contents of a singleton object in TLabel components as well as two collections of objects using TOBjectList<T> objects. The lists are displayed using TListView components and together form a master-detail relationship. Managing the TListView displays given the master-detail relationship is explored.

The source code conforms to a very simplified MVVM or MVC (take your pick) pattern that attempts to separate data from presentation, with Livebindings as the isolating technology. The data presented is arbitrarily created at run time in the Create constructors for the various objects used.
## Obtaining the project source code
Download or clone the files from this Github project to obtain the full source for the project. Also included are some documentation artifacts such as the license, this README file, an overview diagram of the structures involved in LiveBindings Using Objects and other forms of prose documentation. (See the DOCS folder.)
